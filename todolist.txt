for first tests remove the unsquare mazes, and add 2 more sizes.
explore vertical mazes
explore horizontal mazes
DO THESE MAZES WITH THE SAME NUMBER OF CELLS BECAUSE THEN WE CAN SHOW
THEN WE CAN SHARE RUNTIME OF DIFFERENT SHAPED MAZES ACROSS DIFFERENT DATA STRUCTURES
UPDATEWALL AND NEIGHBOURS IN THE REPORT ONLY FOR THEORETICAL
EVERYTHING ELSE GOES IN APPENDIX
THE 3 TESTS WILL GO IN REPORT TOO THOUGH TEST 1 IS PRIORITY.

WRITE WHAT YOU DID EXTRA (INDIVIDUAL TIMINGS OF FUNCTIONS, AND COUNTS FOR NUMBER OF CALLS, AND HOW I DID IT)

MAKE CODE BETTER, AND NOT AI OBVIOUS
ADD COMMENTS TO CODE BETTER

REMOVE EVERYTHING BUT UPDATEWALL, AND NEIGHBOURS FROM REPORT BC NOT MARKED KEEP IN THE REPORT.

add more sizes to the square test

fix theoretical table in appendices too
