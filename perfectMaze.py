# Implement this NOW!

We will then check if the generated mazes are correct,
e.g., whether they are perfect, have correct entrances and exits, didnâ€™t go into infinite
loops etc. We would like you to do some testing about this - if you look at the code,
there is a method to test if the generated maze is perfect, but no implementation. This
implementation will not be part of your assessment, but it might be useful to consider
how to implement this and do checking yourself, as part of practising evaluating your
own code. Remember a perfect maze is one where any cell in the maze can reach any
other cell, or another way to put it, there exists a path between any pair of cells in the
maze. If you do implement something to evaluate for perfect mazes, please do not submit
that as part of your final code submission.
